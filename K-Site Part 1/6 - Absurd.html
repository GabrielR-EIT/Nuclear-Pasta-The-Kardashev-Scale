					<h1>Absurdly Advanced</h1>
					<h3>Before we start, I would first like to request that you, dear reader, humour me for a while and to please take this with a grain of salt.</h3>
						<p>The 1947 Roswell UFO Incident and reports on UFOs (Can’t say it’s aliens when you call them “UNIDENTIFIED”) that spawned the global concept of aliens from outer space are shown to have materials indescribable to human science and spacecraft that are capable of acting in ways that defy all known laws of physics.</p>
					<h3>A Type 4 civilization would be truly UNIVERSAL.</h3>
						<p>The universe is far, far, far too big to travel any meaningful distance for a civilization incapable of accelerating faster than the speed of light, but maybe with the help of a technology that can manipulate spacetime in such a way that distances become irrelevant and their Empire could be spread far and wide. Never splintering into the factions that communications delay would cause.</p>
					<h2>Completely united and utterly cosmic.</h2>
						<p>Some say a sufficiently advanced civilization wouldn’t even be detectable to us because, just as an ant doesn’t think a house is unnatural, the house is just part of the real world, they work on a scale so big that what they do just looks like nature doing it’s job. </p>
						<p>On the other hand…</p>

					<h3>“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”</h3>
					<h4>- Arthur C. Clarke</h4>
						<p>An intelligent being from possibly Type 4+ would appear to us as gods, capable of distorting the very fabric of space to their very whim. Although that example sounds impressive, the thing is, given the right tools, it can be done without violating any known laws or theories.</p>
						<p>Who knows, maybe those little grey or green Area 51 aliens actually are up there watching us, and due to their advanced tech they have warped space, much like a black hole or a galaxy cluster would, so as to allow light coming from behind them bend around the spaceship and passing by as if the ship wasn’t even there. A functional invisibility cloak.</p>
