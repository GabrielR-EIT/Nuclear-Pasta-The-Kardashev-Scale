						<h1>The Project</h1>		
						<p>This website was originally developed by Cameron Wood for an IT Essentials Media Design and Development assignment. It has been modified and repurposed by Nuclear Pasta for an Agile Projects assignment.<br>
						To structure and plan our project development processes, we have followed multiple paradigms / methods of software development. These include the RAD (Rapid Action Development) and Kanban board methods.<br>
						<h3>RAD (Rapid Action Development)</h3>
						This is the primary methodology that our team have based our The Kardashev Scale project on. We chose to follow the RAD model because it was designed for software projects like ours, where existing code can be used to shorten the implementation process. Having less time allocated to building a system allows a team to focus more on reviewing and refining software until clients are satisfied with the design.<br>
						<h3>Kanban Board</h3>
						Nuclear Pasta have created a Trello board with cards for each phase of the development process, divided into lists of completed, in-progress, and to-do tasks. This system helps us keep track of what tasks are to be completed, their due dates, and which team member is assigned to each. We originally adopted Trello to make use of its BigPicture Gantt chart feature, but have since shifted to an Excel sheet to develop our Gantt chart for reasons of convenience.<br><br></p>

						<h1>Product Comparison</h1>
						<p><h3 style="padding-top:0;">Kardashev Scale Wiki</h3><br>
						<strong>Similarities:</strong><br><br>
						<ul>
							<li>Main topic of website is the Kardashev Scale and explains how each civilization level is classified</li><br>
							<li>Both websites make references to science-fiction, e.g., Star Trek</li><br>
						</ul>
						<strong>Differences:</strong><br><br>
						<ul>
							<li>The Kardashev Scale Wiki discusses categories of civilizations specific to the extended Kardashev scale (Type 4+)</li><br>
							<li>Being a public wiki, this website allows anybody to create or edit articles</li><br>
						</ul>
						<strong>Analysis:</strong><br><br>
						We may want to describe civilisation types (Type 4+) beyond those included in Nikolai Kardashev's original scale on our website, for the sake of completeness and also to compete with websites like The Kardashev Scale Wiki that make use of the extended Kardashev scale. Because the scale can expand as far as one's hypothetical imagination, we should be careful to avoid scope creep in our inclusion of speculative civilisation types by limiting the number we add.<br><br>
						<h3>Futurism</h3><br>
						<strong>Similarities:</strong><br><br>
						<ul>
							<li>Futurism's content largely concerns the technological and societal development of humankind</li><br>
							<li>The purpose of the website is to inform readers of factual science and concepts based on theoretical studies</li><br>
						</ul>
						<strong>Differences:</strong><br><br>
						<ul>
							<li>The Futurism website features a newsletter and subscription functionality</li><br>
							<li>Many scientific topics and events are covered on this website, not only the Kardashev Scale</li><br>
							<li>The visual design features a wider spectrum of colours</li><br>
						</ul>
						<strong>Analysis:</strong><br><br>
						An element seen on the Futurism website that could be implemented into our The Kardashev Scale website is links to relevant scientific articles. These articles could be from other science-related websites and be located at the bottom of our pages, under the 'Down The Rabbit Hole' header where the YouTube videos are.<br><br>
						<h3>Daily Galaxy</h3><br>
						<strong>Similarities:</strong><br><br>
						<ul>
							<li>Daily Galaxy's content is highly focused on scientific research, with much emphasis on astronomy, space, and the possibility of extraterrestrial life</li><br>
							<li>The website's visual design features astronomy elements, such as a banner image of space</li><br>
						</ul>
						<strong>Differences:</strong><br><br>
						<ul>
							<li>The Daily Galaxy website features a newsletter and subscription functionality</li><br>
							<li>Articles on this website are written on a variety of subjects, not limited to the Kardashev Scale and categorising civilizations based on technological advancement</li><br>
							<li>Navigation bar is oriented horizontally, rather than vertically</li><br>
							<li>Design of website is more simplistic, i.e., white background, a lot of whitespace</li><br>
							<li>Being a news site, The Daily Galaxy is regularly updated</li><br>
						</ul>
						<h3>Analysis</h3><br>
						One feature of The Daily Galaxy that we could take inspiration from is its newsletter. The Kardashev Scale could allow visitors to subscribe and receive emails about news and updates related to our website. To do so, they would need to enter their email address and (possibly) name before clicking a 'Subscribe' button to be added to the mailing list.</p>
