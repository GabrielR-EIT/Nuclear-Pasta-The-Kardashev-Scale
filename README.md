    The purpose is to design and develop a website that promotes a particular topic. The scope of this project is one website.
  
    The constraints for this project are time (7 weeks), budget (minimal), the technology we have access to, the capabilities of website users, number of team members (2) and the extent of their applicable skills. 
  
    The benefits of creating our website include: producing a product that can be accessed by users and is informative about the relevant topic.
  
    The major tasks for our project will be: initiation, project planning, execution, and closure.

Work Breakdown Structure (WBS): table-based information includes (week, start date, end date, task requirements, completed by) 

    Start Date: 3/05/2021 
    End Date / Completed By: 
    Task Requirements: The end product of this process should be functional, readable, and informative, consistent with modern information and web standards. 

Description of products (product features, an analysis of competing products, reflections analysis)

        Product Features:
        
        Our final product / website is to feature nine web pages (Introduction, About, Fermi and Drake, Type 1 Civilizations, Type 2 Civilizations, Type 3 Civilizations, Absurdly Advanced, Bibliography, and Contact) detailing the theory behind the Kardashev scale, its levels, a list of sources for any external material appropriated, and a section providing contact details (email address, password, etc.) for our organisation.
        
        The information provided on our website will be delivered through text, static images, animated images (.gifs), and sourced videos. There will be a gallery displaying several interactive image elements and users will be able to navigate the site by scrolling up/down and clicking links to other pages located on the navigation bar.
